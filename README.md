# About this repository

This repository contains a selection of projects that demonstrate my analytical thinking, coding abilities, and understanding of various concepts. The projects in this repository come from various sources, such as school, work, and personal projects. These projects are meant to highlight my skills and knowledge in a diverse array of areas.

## Projects

### [Conjoint Analysis](https://github.com/mj8295/Data_Projects/blob/35efdd8ab02984b77d96d31036999c1073454ecb/docs/ConjointAnalysis.md)
In this project, we will investigate the use of conjoint analysis on an academic dataset. The goal is to determine the optimal product feature mix that maximizes profit for the firm while minimizing competitor response. This project was completed as part of my studies at the Simon School of Business at the University of Rochester.
### [Predictive Model Training and Evaluation](https://github.com/mj8295/Data_Projects/blob/35efdd8ab02984b77d96d31036999c1073454ecb/docs/PredictiveModel.md)
In this project, we will examine the process of training, tuning, and validating a predictive model. The objective is to develop the most accurate model by experimenting with various techniques. This project was completed during my studies at the Simon School of Business at the University of Rochester.
### [Cross Shopping Analysis](https://github.com/mj8295/Data_Projects/blob/836cdd8b9fc4f54d3d957de6d0bd45cf439f4f1b/docs/CrossShopping.md)
In this project, we will perform an analysis that explores the concept of cross shopping.  The objective is to identify the loyalty of customers and the company'slargest competitor.  This project was completed during my studies at the Simon School of Business at the University of Rochester.
### [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](link to project)
In this project, we will investigate the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a technique for analyzing text, by analyzing a dataset of Twitter data. Our goal is to identify the event that occurred on a given day. This project was completed as part of my studies at the Simon School of Business at the University of Rochester.
