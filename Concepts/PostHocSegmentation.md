# Post-Hoc Segmentation

Post-hoc segmentation is the process of dividing a market into distinct groups of consumers based on characteristics that are discovered as a result of market research. Unlike a priori segmentation, which relies on pre-existing market knowledge or assumptions about different segments, post-hoc segmentation involves analyzing data to identify patterns and trends which can be used to define segments. The objective of post-hoc segmentation is to discover new segments or to refine previously defined segments based on data.
