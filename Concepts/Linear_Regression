# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the response variable) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictor variables). The goal of linear regression is to find the values of the coefficients (also known as weights) that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the observed values.

The predicted values are calculated using the following equation:

predicted value = intercept + coefficient1 * x1 + coefficient2 * x2 + ...

where x1, x2, etc. are the predictor variables, and the coefficients (also known as weights) are the values that are learned during the model training process. The intercept is a constant that represents the value of the dependent variable when all the predictor variables are equal to zero.

Linear regression can be used for both regression (predicting a continuous value) and classification (predicting a categorical value). In the case of regression, the predicted values are continuous and can take any value within a certain range. In the case of classification, the predicted values are categorical and take one of a limited number of class labels.
