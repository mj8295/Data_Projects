# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a statistical model that is used to discover the underlying topics that are present in a collection of documents. It does this by representing each document as a mixture of a small number of topics, and each topic as a mixture of a large number of words.

LDA is a generative model, meaning that it can generate new documents that are similar to the ones in the training data. It does this by sampling from the mixture of topics and the mixture of words for each topic.

LDA is often used in natural language processing and information retrieval tasks, such as document classification and topic modeling. It is also used in other fields, such as social sciences and marketing, to uncover the main themes or topics in a collection of text data.

LDA is a probabilistic model, and the process of discovering the topics in a collection of documents is referred to as "inference." Inference is done using a variety of algorithms, including collapsed Gibbs sampling and variational inference.
