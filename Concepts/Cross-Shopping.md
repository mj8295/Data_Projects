# Cross Shopping

Cross-shopping refers to the practice of consumers shopping at multiple retailers or stores for a particular product or service. In the context of business analytics, cross-shopping can be used to analyze consumer behavior and identify patterns in the way that consumers shop across different retailers or channels.

For example, a business analyst might use cross-shopping data to identify which retailers or channels are most popular among a particular customer segment, or to understand how consumers' shopping habits change over time. This information can be used to inform business strategy, such as how to allocate marketing budget, which channels to prioritize, or how to improve the customer experience across different retailers or channels.

Cross-shopping data can be collected through a variety of methods, including customer surveys, loyalty card data, or online tracking tools. It is important to carefully consider the sources of cross-shopping data and ensure that they are reliable and representative of the target population.
