# A Priori Segmentation

A priori segmentation is the process of dividing a market into distinct groups of consumers based on characteristics that are believed to exist prior to conducting any market research. This type of segmentation is typically based on demographic, geographic, and behavioral characteristics. The objective of a priori segmentation is to identify segments that are likely to exist, collect data to confirm their existence, and understand each segmentâ€™s characteristics.
