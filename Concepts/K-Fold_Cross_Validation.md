# K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-fold cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It involves randomly dividing the dataset into k subsets, or folds, of approximately equal size. The model is then trained on k-1 of the folds and tested on the remaining one. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold being used as the test set each time. The performance measure is then averaged across all k iterations to produce a single estimation.

The advantage of k-fold cross-validation over other methods, such as holdout validation, is that it allows the model to be trained and tested on all observations in the dataset, which can provide a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance. It is also useful when the dataset is small, as it allows the model to be trained and tested on a larger portion of the data.

The value of k is typically chosen to be 5 or 10, but there is no strict rule. A larger value of k will provide a more accurate estimate of the model's performance, but will also be computationally more expensive.
