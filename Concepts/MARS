# Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines

Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is a non-parametric regression model that can be used to model complex, non-linear relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Unlike linear regression, which assumes that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear, MARS allows for more flexibility by fitting multiple regression splines to the data.

A regression spline is a piecewise-defined polynomial function that is fit to the data using knots, which are the points at which the polynomial pieces join together. The knots are chosen based on the data, and the polynomial pieces are fit to the data within the knots. The polynomial degree (i.e., the number of terms in the polynomial) and the locations of the knots are determined automatically by the MARS algorithm.

MARS is well-suited for modeling complex, non-linear relationships and can handle a large number of predictor variables. However, it can be computationally intensive and may not be suitable for very large datasets.
