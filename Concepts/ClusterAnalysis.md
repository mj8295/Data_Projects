# Cluster Analysis

Cluster analysis is a technique used to classify a set of observations into groups (called clusters or segments) such that the observations within each cluster are similar to one another, and different from the observations in other clusters. This concept is called homogeneity within, heterogeneity between.  There are different algorithms for performing cluster analysis, but most involve iteratively partitioning the data into clusters based on some measure of similarity or distance between observations.


One popular algorithm for cluster analysis is k-means, which partitions the data into k clusters by iteratively reassigning each observation to the cluster whose mean is closest to it. In k-means clustering, the number of clusters is usually determined by the researcher however it can also be determined by an algorithm.


Cluster analysis is widely used in market research, customer segmentation, image analysis, and many other fields. It can be used to identify patterns and structure in data that may not be obvious when looking at individual observations.
