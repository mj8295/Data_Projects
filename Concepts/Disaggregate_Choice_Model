# Disaggregate Choice Model

Disaggregate choice models are a type of statistical model that are used to analyze and understand how individuals make choices among a set of alternatives. These models are typically used to understand consumer behavior and can be used to predict the likelihood of individuals choosing a specific product or service. Disaggregate choice models allow for the presence of unobserved characteristics that affect an individual's choice.  This allows the analyst to avoid the need for consumers to rank every model.

These models are widely used in transportation, marketing, and economics, to forecast the demand of certain products, to evaluate the impact of different policies and to understand consumer behavior.

Overall, disaggregate choice models are useful tools for understanding and predicting consumer behavior, and can be used to inform business and policy decisions.
